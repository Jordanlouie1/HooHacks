Credibly
Our group comprises people from minority backgrounds, so we thought about how we could help marginalized groups find jobs.

Our website helps people who struggle with gaining credibility due to reasons such as getting out of jail recently, moving to a new town, and etc. Helping them make a profile and such, allows them to use it to apply to job postings and get their name out to employers.

We built the website using React and MongoDB, with a mix of back-end and front-end development. 

Learning how to use React for the first time and connecting to the database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to create a functional website using the React library from knowing very little to nothing about it.
## What we learned
We learned how to use React to create a website for our platform. We also learned more about how to implement mongoDB databases into our system.
What's next for Credibly is making the website fully functional and pushing our platform to actually help society. This will potentially become a passion project for us.
